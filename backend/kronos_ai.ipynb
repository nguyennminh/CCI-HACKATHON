      "Overall Score: 65/100\n",
      "Injury Risk: MODERATE\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk Explanation: Significant shoulder over-rotation and insufficient elbow extension increase risk of rotator cuff strains and elbow tendinitis. Contact point too low reduces power efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: Technique shows good foundation with strong racket speed potential, but requires correction of shoulder over-rotation, insufficient elbow extension, and contact point height to reduce injury risk and optimize power. Focus on maintaining stable shoulder position while rotating torso, and practicing full arm extension with proper contact height.\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive Feedback: Excellent racket head speed generation potential and good overall smash mechanics. Your torso rotation and lower body engagement appear strong. Keep focusing on these positive elements while correcting the specific form issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "=== CRITICAL ISSUES ===\n",
      "\n",
      "1. SHOULDER\n",
      "   Problem: Over-rotation at impact (81.3¬∞ vs reference 23.1¬∞)\n",
      "   Injury Risk: Excessive shoulder internal rotation strains rotator cuff muscles, particularly the supraspinatus, increasing risk of tendinitis or impingement.\n",
      "   Correction: Maintain forward shoulder position; rotate torso rather than shoulder joint\n",
      "   Drill: Wall arm rotation drill: Stand facing a wall, arm outstretched, rotate torso while keeping shoulder stable\n",
      "\n",
      "2. ELBOW\n",
      "   Problem: Too bent at impact (159.1¬∞ vs reference 174.9¬∞)\n",
      "   Injury Risk: Bent elbow position creates unnecessary stress on elbow tendons during impact, increasing risk of tennis elbow-like tendinitis.\n",
      "   Correction: Fully extend elbow at contact point; maintain straighter arm position\n",
      "   Drill: Static forearm extension holds: Hold racket in backhand position, extend arm fully with elbow straight for 30 seconds\n",
      "\n",
      "3. BODY POSITION\n",
      "   Problem: Contact point too low (-0.100 vs reference -0.149)\n",
      "   Injury Risk: Lower contact point forces excessive wrist extension and shoulder strain, compromising power and increasing overuse injury risk.\n",
      "   Correction: Practice reaching higher with full arm extension; focus on racket head speed generation\n",
      "   Drill: High contact zone target practice: Use small targets placed progressively higher on the court\n"
