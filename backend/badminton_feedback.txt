BADMINTON FORM FEEDBACK
============================================================

⭐ Overall Score: 25/100
🏥 Injury Risk: HIGH

📋 Risk Explanation:
   Excessive shoulder rotation and bent elbow at impact create significant internal shoulder stress and increase risk of rotator cuff injuries and elbow strain.

📝 Summary:
   Significant form adjustments needed to prevent shoulder/elbow injuries and maximize power. Focus on neutral shoulder position and full elbow extension. With proper technique correction, you can develop powerful, safe smashes.

✅ What You're Doing Well:
   Good core engagement and racket speed observed. Your arm extension shows potential for power development if angles are corrected. Maintaining racket face stability is a positive technical foundation.

⚠️  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
============================================================

1. SHOULDER
   ❌ Problem: Over-rotation detected (80.4° vs reference 28.3°)
   🏥 Injury Risk: Excessive internal rotation causes abnormal stress on rotator cuff muscles and labrum, increasing risk of shoulder impingement, strains, or tears.
   ✅ Correction: Maintain a more neutral shoulder position at contact, limit rotation to 30-40° internally from neutral
   💪 Drill: Shoulder rotation drill against wall: Stand facing wall, throw forehand smash with controlled 45° shoulder rotation without full body twist

2. ELBOW
   ❌ Problem: Too bent at impact (147.7° vs reference 165.8°)
   🏥 Injury Risk: Bent elbow at full extension increases valgus stress on elbow joint, raising risk of UCL (ulnar collateral ligament) strain or tennis elbow.
   ✅ Correction: Extend elbow fully at contact point while maintaining racket face stability
   💪 Drill: Elbow extension drill: Perform smash with racket held at 45°, focus on extending elbow fully without wrist bend

3. BODY POSITION
   ❌ Problem: Contact point too low (-0.082 vs reference -0.153)
   🏥 Injury Risk: Lower contact point forces excessive trunk lean and shoulder elevation, increasing torque on shoulder joint and neck muscles.
   ✅ Correction: Time jump higher or initiate earlier for optimal head-high contact point
   💪 Drill: Vertical smash drill: Practice hitting smash at head level using a high serve feed
