BADMINTON FORM FEEDBACK
============================================================

⭐ Overall Score: 35/100
🏥 Injury Risk: HIGH

📋 Risk Explanation:
   Your smash form shows significant issues, primarily an over-rotated shoulder and a bent elbow at impact, which substantially increase the risk of shoulder injuries like rotator cuff strains or tendinitis, and elbow injuries like tennis elbow. Poor contact point height also reduces smash effectiveness and places undue stress on the upper body.

📝 Summary:
   Your smash technique requires focused attention on reducing shoulder rotation, extending your elbow, and elevating your contact point. Addressing these key areas will not only enhance your smash effectiveness and power but also significantly reduce your risk of common badminton shoulder and elbow injuries. Continued practice with these corrective measures will lead to substantial improvements.

✅ What You're Doing Well:
   You've demonstrated good foundational skills, including a strong and powerful swing through the shuttlecock, which indicates good core engagement and overall swing mechanics. Your dedication to improving your technique is evident and commendable.

⚠️  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
============================================================

1. SHOULDER
   ❌ Problem: Over-rotation detected (Your angle: 80.4° vs Reference: 28.3°)
   🏥 Injury Risk: Excessive shoulder rotation significantly increases stress on the rotator cuff muscles and tendons, raising the risk of strains or tendinitis. This is the highest risk factor identified.
   ✅ Correction: Focus on maintaining a forward-facing shoulder position at impact. Keep your shoulder pointing forward, not rotating excessively.
   💪 Drill: Wall Smash Drill: Stand facing a wall at arm's length. Perform smashes while keeping your shoulder forward and square to the wall. Emphasize a straight arm finish.

2. ELBOW
   ❌ Problem: Elbow too bent at impact (Your angle: 147.7° vs Reference: 165.8°)
   🏥 Injury Risk: A bent elbow during the smash increases stress on the elbow joint and surrounding tendons, particularly the extensor carpi radialis brevis, heightening the risk of tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis).
   ✅ Correction: Extend your arm fully as it contacts the shuttlecock. Imagine reaching as far as you can with a straight arm while maintaining control.
   💪 Drill: Target Smash Drill: Place a small object (e.g., a tennis ball) at your natural full-extension point. Practice smashes by hitting the object, focusing on a straight arm and an extended elbow at contact.

3. OVERALL TECHNIQUE
   ❌ Problem: Contact point too low (Your height: -0.082 vs Reference: -0.153)
   🏥 Injury Risk: A low contact point forces the upper body to compensate, leading to increased stress on the shoulders and elbows. It also reduces smash power and accuracy, and can contribute to poor overall body mechanics.
   ✅ Correction: Jump higher during your smash approach or time your jump so that the shuttlecock reaches you at a higher point in your jump.
   💪 Drill: High Jump Smash Drill: Practice jumping as high as possible with a full arm swing. Focus on initiating the swing early and making contact with the shuttlecock at the peak of your jump.

4. OVERALL TECHNIQUE
   ❌ Problem: Insufficient arm extension at impact (Your extension: 0.105 vs Reference: 0.160)
   🏥 Injury Risk: Lack of full arm extension reduces the power of your smash and places undue stress on the shoulder and elbow joints to compensate for the shortened range of motion.
   ✅ Correction: Work on a longer follow-through and ensure your arm reaches its full extension before the follow-through, not just at impact.
   💪 Drill: Long Follow-Through Smash Drill: After hitting the shuttlecock, focus on extending your arm and racket hand high above your head, maintaining this position for a moment before lowering.
