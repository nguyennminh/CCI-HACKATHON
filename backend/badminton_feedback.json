  "overall_score": 42,
  "injury_risk": "MODERATE",
  "injury_risk_explanation": "Excessive shoulder over-rotation and an overly bent elbow at impact are primary concerns, significantly increasing the risk of shoulder injuries like rotator cuff strains or impingements. Early contact due to lower contact point also contributes to joint stress.",
  "critical_issues": [
    {
      "body_part": "shoulder",
      "problem": "Shoulder over-rotation (81.3째 vs. 23.1째)",
      "injury_risk": "Excessive internal rotation creates abnormal stress on the rotator cuff muscles and labrum, increasing risk of impingement, strains, and long-term shoulder instability.",
      "correction": "Maintain a more closed, stable shoulder position during the smash, focusing on controlled extension rather than aggressive rotation.",
      "drill": "Wall smash drill with focus on controlled shoulder extension and minimal rotation. Use a mirror for immediate feedback."
    },
    {
      "body_part": "elbow",
      "problem": "Overly bent elbow at impact (159.1째 vs. 174.9째)",
      "injury_risk": "A bent elbow during impact compromises racket head speed and creates undue stress on the elbow joint (medial epicondyle), increasing risk of tennis elbow type injuries.",
      "correction": "Extend your arm fully through the smash, ensuring the elbow is straight but not locked at impact.",
      "drill": "Slow-motion smash with elbow extension focus. Practice hitting a stationary shuttlecock with full arm extension while maintaining a stable elbow."
    },
    {
      "body_part": "entire arm",
      "problem": "Too early impact point (-0.100 vs. -0.149)",
      "injury_risk": "Striking the shuttle too early forces the arm to decelerate rapidly, creating abnormal stresses through the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints.",
      "correction": "Delay the smash slightly to allow your body to generate maximum acceleration and reach the optimal contact point with a fully extended arm.",
      "drill": "Shuttlecock toss drill: Practice tossing a shuttlecock high and deep, then focusing on a delayed, full-extension smash with proper follow-through."
    }
  ],
  "positive_feedback": "Your smash has good foundation mechanics with strong wrist and racket head speed. The emphasis on maintaining wrist extension and racket face angle through impact is commendable. With focus on the technical corrections, you're well-positioned to develop a powerful and injury-resistant smash technique.",
  "summary": "The smash technique shows promise with good wrist action, but requires significant refinement in shoulder positioning, elbow extension, and impact timing. Addressing these issues will not only enhance power and accuracy but is crucial for long-term injury prevention, particularly in the shoulder and elbow."
