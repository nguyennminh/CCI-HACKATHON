  "overall_score": 30,
  "injury_risk": "HIGH",
  "injury_risk_explanation": "The significantly bent elbow angle (15.9° vs. reference 165.8°) and over-rotated shoulder (88.1° vs. reference 28.3°) create substantial stress on the shoulder and elbow joints, particularly the rotator cuff and UCL. This form is highly inefficient for power generation and increases the risk of acute injuries (like tears) and chronic overuse conditions.",
  "critical_issues": [
    {
      "body_part": "shoulder",
      "problem": "Over-rotation detected (88.1° vs. reference 28.3°)",
      "injury_risk": "This excessive rotation places extreme torque on the shoulder joint, particularly the rotator cuff muscles and labrum, leading to a high risk of strains, tears, and chronic impingement. It also compromises control and follow-through.",
      "correction": "Minimize shoulder rotation; focus on generating power primarily from the torso (trunk rotation) rather than the shoulder joint itself. The back of the hitting shoulder should ideally be squared to the net or only slightly rotated.",
      "drill": "Shadow smash drills with a focus on trunk rotation: Start in a ready position, rotate from the hips and core, and extend the arm as if hitting. Use a mirror or video to monitor shoulder alignment. Practice the 'Chinese Wall' drill against a wall, emphasizing trunk drive."
    },
    {
      "body_part": "elbow",
      "problem": "Elbow too bent at impact (15.9° vs. reference 165.8°)",
      "injury_risk": "A bent elbow significantly increases stress on the elbow joint, particularly the Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL) and tendons. This is a major contributor to 'tennis elbow' (lateral epicondylitis) and 'golfer's elbow' (medial epicondylitis), common in racquet sports.",
      "correction": "Extend the elbow fully at contact. Imagine reaching your racket as far back as possible before the smash, then extending powerfully through the ball of the shuttle. The elbow should be straight or nearly straight at impact.",
      "drill": "High elbow smash drills: Practice smashing with a focus on keeping the elbow extended. You can use a wall for feedback or have a coach observe. Perform slow-motion smashes, exaggerating the elbow extension through the point of contact. Resistance band exercises for the triceps can also help strengthen the extensor mechanism."
    },
    {
      "body_part": "arm/wrist",
      "problem": "Insufficient arm extension and low contact point (Arm extension: 0.017 vs. 0.160; Contact point too low)",
      "injury_risk": "Low contact point and insufficient arm extension force the wrist into an awkward, extended, and possibly hyperextended position upon impact, increasing the risk of wrist sprains and strains. It also reduces the power and effectiveness of the smash, leading to compensatory movements that can strain other joints.",
      "correction": "Jump higher to reach the optimal contact point (higher than the shuttle's apex) and ensure full arm extension through the point of contact. The arm should be fully extended and powerfully driven through the shuttle.",
      "drill": "Jumping smash drills: Focus on timing your jump to meet the shuttle at its highest point or slightly before. Practice full arm extension through the ball of the shuttle. Use a lower shuttlecock initially to practice the technique before incorporating speed. Plyometric exercises like box jumps can improve jumping ability."

  "positive_feedback": "Your commitment to technique improvement is evident. You possess good foundational badminton skills and agility, which are excellent starting points. The power generation mechanics are generally on track, indicating a strong potential for improvement with focused form correction.",
  "summary": "Your badminton smash technique requires significant improvement in joint angles and timing to enhance power, control, and crucially, to prevent injury. The current form, particularly the bent elbow and over-rotated shoulder, presents a high risk of common badminton injuries. Prioritizing drills that correct these issues will lead to a more powerful, efficient, and safer smash. Continued practice with these corrections will yield substantial benefits."
