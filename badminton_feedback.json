  "overall_score": 25,
  "injury_risk": "HIGH",
  "injury_risk_explanation": "Excessive shoulder rotation and bent elbow at impact create significant internal shoulder stress and increase risk of rotator cuff injuries and elbow strain.",
  "critical_issues": [
    {
      "body_part": "shoulder",
      "problem": "Over-rotation detected (80.4° vs reference 28.3°)",
      "injury_risk": "Excessive internal rotation causes abnormal stress on rotator cuff muscles and labrum, increasing risk of shoulder impingement, strains, or tears.",
      "correction": "Maintain a more neutral shoulder position at contact, limit rotation to 30-40° internally from neutral",
      "drill": "Shoulder rotation drill against wall: Stand facing wall, throw forehand smash with controlled 45° shoulder rotation without full body twist"
    },
    {
      "body_part": "elbow",
      "problem": "Too bent at impact (147.7° vs reference 165.8°)",
      "injury_risk": "Bent elbow at full extension increases valgus stress on elbow joint, raising risk of UCL (ulnar collateral ligament) strain or tennis elbow.",
      "correction": "Extend elbow fully at contact point while maintaining racket face stability",
      "drill": "Elbow extension drill: Perform smash with racket held at 45°, focus on extending elbow fully without wrist bend"
    },
    {
      "body_part": "body position",
      "problem": "Contact point too low (-0.082 vs reference -0.153)",
      "injury_risk": "Lower contact point forces excessive trunk lean and shoulder elevation, increasing torque on shoulder joint and neck muscles.",
      "correction": "Time jump higher or initiate earlier for optimal head-high contact point",
      "drill": "Vertical smash drill: Practice hitting smash at head level using a high serve feed"
    }
  ],
  "positive_feedback": "Good core engagement and racket speed observed. Your arm extension shows potential for power development if angles are corrected. Maintaining racket face stability is a positive technical foundation.",
  "summary": "Significant form adjustments needed to prevent shoulder/elbow injuries and maximize power. Focus on neutral shoulder position and full elbow extension. With proper technique correction, you can develop powerful, safe smashes."
