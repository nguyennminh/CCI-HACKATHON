  "overall_score": 25,
  "injury_risk": "HIGH",
  "injury_risk_explanation": "The current smash form presents a significant risk of shoulder injuries, primarily due to excessive shoulder over-rotation and insufficient elbow extension, which can strain the rotator cuff. Additionally, the low contact point and poor arm extension increase stress on the elbow and shoulder during impact.",
  "critical_issues": [
    {
      "body_part": "shoulder",
      "problem": "Excessive shoulder over-rotation at impact (88.1° vs. reference 28.3°)",
      "injury_risk": "This over-rotation places excessive torque on the shoulder joint and rotator cuff muscles, significantly increasing the risk of strains, tendinitis, or labral tears – common injuries in badminton.",
      "correction": "Focus on a more compact, controlled shoulder rotation. The primary power should come from the legs and torso, with the shoulder blade (scapula) retracting and rotating efficiently rather than the shoulder joint itself rotating excessively.",
      "drill": "1. Wall Push-ups: Practice against a wall, focusing on scapular retraction and controlled shoulder movement. 2. Medicine Ball Rotational Throws (low intensity): Use a light medicine ball to emphasize torso rotation and proper sequencing of the smash."
    },
    {
      "body_part": "elbow",
      "problem": "Excessively bent elbow at impact (15.9° vs. reference 165.8°)",
      "injury_risk": "A hyper-flexed elbow at contact significantly increases stress on the elbow joint (ulnar nerve, ligaments) and can lead to issues like tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) or golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis). It also compromises racket head speed and direction.",
      "correction": "At the moment of impact, the elbow should be fully extended (straight) to maximize reach and power while minimizing joint stress. Practice extending the arm fully through the point of contact.",
      "drill": "1. Static Elbow Extension Hold: With racket in smash position, hold the elbow fully extended for 5-10 seconds, gradually building up endurance. 2. Target Smash Practice: Aim for high, distant targets to naturally encourage full elbow extension and jump height."
    },
    {
      "body_part": "upper body",
      "problem": "Low contact point (-0.011 vs. reference -0.153) and insufficient arm extension (0.017 vs. reference 0.160)",
      "injury_risk": "Smashing from too low a position and with limited arm extension forces the shoulder and elbow into awkward and potentially injurious positions. It can lead to shoulder impingement and overuse injuries due to the shortened range of motion and increased joint compression.",
      "correction": "Jump higher to reach the optimal contact point (higher in the air), and ensure the arm is fully extended through the contact zone. This allows for a more natural and powerful swing with reduced joint strain.",
      "drill": "1. High Jump Smash Practice: Use a target elevated slightly above net height to encourage jumping higher and full arm extension. 2. Shadow Smashes with Visualization: Practice shadow smashes while mentally focusing on extending the arm fully and contacting the ball at a higher point."

  "positive_feedback": "Your foundation of initiating the smash with proper racket preparation and follow-through is solid, and your dedication to improving is evident. With focused work on the corrective tips, you'll be well on your way to developing a powerful and safe smash technique.",
  "summary": "Your current smash form has a high injury risk, particularly for shoulder issues, due to excessive shoulder rotation, a bent elbow at contact, and a low contact point with limited arm extension. Prioritizing corrections to achieve full elbow extension, a higher and more appropriate contact point, and controlled shoulder mechanics will not only reduce injury risk but also enhance the power and effectiveness of your smash."
